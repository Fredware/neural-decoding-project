# neural-decoding-project
This project is part of the [ECE 6654](https://student.apps.utah.edu/uofu/stu/ClassSchedules/main/1228/description.html?subj=ECE&catno=6654&section=001) course at the University of Utah.
In this project, students use Matlab code to:
1. Analyze neural signals from a Utah Slanted Electrode Array
2. Extract features from neural signals
3. Train an Artificial Neural Network to decode hand motion information from neural signals

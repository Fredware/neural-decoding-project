# neural-decoding-project
This project is part of the ECE 6654 course at the University of Utah.
In this project, students use Matlab code to:
1. Analyze neural signals from a Utah Slanted Electrode Array
2. Extract features from neural signals
3. Train an Artificial Neural Network to decode hand motion information from neural signals
